              the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, more massive than its near-twin Uranus."
              descStructure="Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core.
              Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions."
              descGeology="Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium. A trace amount of methane is also present.
              Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum."
